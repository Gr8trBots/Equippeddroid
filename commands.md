## Commands list
This list will be updated, when we add new commands to the bot! Please remember, that some of the commands **might** work only on our bot (The bot we host and that is avalible on our discord server)
If you are having issues with **the bot we host**, submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/discordies/DiscordDeviantDestroyer/issues)! We do not help with bots not working properly, if they are self-hosted (hosted by you or someone else, not us)
